Once upon a time in mystical Shangri-La, there lived two great friends named David and Bryan.
At dawn on the third day, a strange creature appeared on the horizon.
Its body, green as grass with a purple tongue roars "I AM PICCOLO!"
As Piccolo saw Hassan and Barak only one thought was on his mind.
In a flash, there was another presence in the area.
"GOKU!?!?!" yelled Piccolo, "help me fight Hassan and Barak for their 4 star Dragon ball"
Then Goku began to power up a huge amount of energy and Transformed in to Super Saiyan level 4!!!
"SUPER SAIYAN LEVEL 4??" yelled Hassan. "THAT'S OVER 9000!!" Hassan and Barak begin to tremble.
David and Bryan, not a pair to be outdone, performed the fusion dance, combining their power and became Bravid.
