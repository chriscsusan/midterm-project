Once upon a time in mystical Shangri-La, there lived two great friends named Hassan and Barak.
At dawn on the third day, a strange creature appeared on the horizon.
Its body, green as grass with a purple tongue roars "I AM PICCOLO!"
As Piccolo saw Hassan and Barak only one thought was on his mind.
In a flash, there was another presence in the area.
